## FAQs

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
Markdown offers a simpler and more lightweight syntax compared to traditional word processors, making it easier to create and maintain documents. Additionally, Markdown files are plain text, which means you don't have to worry about compatibility between devices, and they can be easily version-controlled using tools like Git.

### Why is my resume not showing up?
Double-check that your resume file is named correctly and has the ".md" extension. Also, ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled for your repository and that the correct branch is selected as the source for your site. It may take a few minutes for changes to reflect on your hosted resume. If the issue persists, review the GitHub Pages documentation for troubleshooting tips.
